**Big O Notation in Algorithm Analysis**

Introduction

Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity. It also helps in the comparison of algorithms.
Rules of Big O Notation

i. Constant Time Complexity[O(1)]
an algorithm has the constant time complexity if it's execution time usually doesn't depend on the size of input.
Example:
public static int getFirstElement(int[] arr) {
    return arr[0];
}


ii.Linear Time Complexiity [O(n)] 
An algorithm has time linear complexity if the execution time increases linearrly with the size of the input.
Example:
public static void printAll(int[] arr) {
    for (int i : arr) {
        System.out.println(i);
    }
}




iii. Quadratic Time Complexity [O(n^2)] 
A quadratic time complexity occurs when the algorithm contains nested loops that are iterating over the same dataset 
example:
public static void printAllPairs(int[] arr) {
    for (int i : arr) {
        for (int j : arr) {
            System.out.println(i + ", " + j);
        }
    }
}


iv. Logarithmic Time Complexity [O(logn)]
Alogarithmic time complexity occurs when the algorithm reduces the problem size in each step.
Example:
public static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
    int low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;

    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target) return mid;
        else if (arr[mid] < target) low = mid + 1;
        else high = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1;
}




v.Drop Constants and Lower order Terms
In the big O notation, the constants and the lower oder term such as O(2n)
O(n!).
