**Difference between arrays and linked lists**


Memory Allocation -
Arrays: all elements in arrays are usually stored next to each other in memory. they require more memory due to fixed allocation.
the size of arrays is fixed at the time of declaration therefore it is neccessary for the number to be defined beforehand.
Linked lists: all nodes in linked lists are ususally stored where one node points to the next.
nodes are created only when they are needed .


Performance-
arrays:access to arrays is in the constant time complexity because any element is directly accessible using an index. Insertions and deletions require a linear time complexity because of element shifting.
Linked lists:access to inked lists is in linear time complexity because of their linear transversal and in insertion and deletion they use constant time complexity because they reassign pointer refences without shifting any other nodes.


Insertion and deletion-
arrays: Insertion and deletion are in linear time complexity when they are performed at the beggining or middle of the array due to element shifting.
Linked Lists: insertion and deletion is in constant time complexity which is at the head or tail but have a linear time complexity while doing modifications in the middle
